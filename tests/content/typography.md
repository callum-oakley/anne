Despite working almost exclusively on backend software, I'm pretty enthusiastic about design, and especially about typography. This blog is as much an opportunity for me to play with fonts and typography as it is to do some writing. With that in mind I wanted to mention the fonts I was using -- for anyone else who's into that:

- The text face is Bold Monday's [Quinn Text][], designed by Diana Ovezea.
- Headings are set in Matthew Butterick's [Concourse][].
- Code snippets are set in [IBM Plex Mono][], also from Bold Monday.

If you think this site is pleasant to look at, or if I've made some huge typographic faux pas, then please let me know! I'd love to get better. Also, if you share my enthusiasm for typography, I have two book recommendations, both of which I enjoyed immensely:

- Robert Bringhurst's *The Elements of Typographic Style* -- very thorough, a pleasure to read, and probably the most beautiful book in the world.
- Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography][] -- as the name implies: especially good for practical concerns like the actual <span class="sc">css</span> incantations to use. Also a shining example of what a digital book should look like.
